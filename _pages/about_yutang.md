I'm a second year undergraduate student in **General Artificial Intelligence Experimental Class** within [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yixin Zhu](https://yzhu.io/). My research interests focus on the intersection of **Computer Vision** 👁️, **Robotics** 🤖, and **Reinforcement Learning** 🎮, where I explore how intelligent systems perceive, learn, and interact. Beyond research, I enjoy staying active and competitive on the tennis court 🎾. I am passionate about advancing AI capabilities and their practical applications. I welcome discussions on AI, collaborative projects, or shared interests—feel free to connect!
